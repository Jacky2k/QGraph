QGraph is a class to plot graphs in a QWidget.
QGraph is based on a QWidget and can thus be used like a QWidget.
There are several functions to add data to the graph. It is posible
to add more than one line at the same time. As you also have to
provide the x coordinates of your data it is possible to use different
x coordinate sets for different lines.
As plot methods you can choose between lines, stems and bars.

follow the instructrions below:
Linux:
  $ qmake

==Known Bugs==
* Zooming too deep in will cause the application to crash. 
  I don't know yet how to fix this.
* Zooming too far out will cause the graph to become blank.
  I don't know yet how to fix this.
* When zooming to deep in there will be graphics errors. For example
  a line changes its gradient, dissappears or looks like stairs.
  For some reasons this happens only on Mac and Windows. Linux is not
  affected.

==Missing features / Things to do==
* Add a setData function to plot a histogram
* Add setData functions to pass the data as double pointer
* Add more comfortable setData functions. For example seperate
  functions to add lines, stems and bars.
* Add support for OpenGL
* Add a legend to describe the graphs
* Write a documentation
* Fix the bugs ;)
